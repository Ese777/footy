    <h2>Pele</h2>
    <p>Pele was one of the greatest people to ever have kicked a ball. The king was born in the South American nation of Brazil on 23 October 1940 where he first started his football journey at Santos aged 15. Immediately he became a star and played in his first Fifa World Cup aged 17. That was a tournament he would never forget. He won Brazil their World Cup that year scoring a double against Sweden. After that dazzling performance, the Brazilians called him O Rei &#40;The King&#40;. He won two more World Cup in 1962 and 1970, scored 778 goals and 352 assists before retiring aged 36. He was still being recognised by people and in 2013 he won a special prize in the Ballon D'or right next to a player I'll mention later. The whole world had stopped at the announcement of the death of O Rei on the 29th of December 2022.</p>
